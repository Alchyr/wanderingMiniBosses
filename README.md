# WANDERING MINI BOSSES \O/ (also, StS 2nd Anniversary Mod)

The framework for this mod:

Monsters that appear in the middle of combat and stay for a few rounds during which they do actions (like debuffs, attacks, etc) after which they'll run away. All damage they incurred will be saved and when you encounter them again, they'll have the same health.
Encountering them in a hgiher act changes their movement pattern/damage/whatever.
Killing them results in a neat relic/card/potion/whatever reward.

You only have one monster per run, it's decided at the start of the run.
Monsters will stay about 3 turns.
Health should be around act 2 boss range.

Current odds of a wandering mini boss showing up in a room:
15% at first per combat, goes up by 7% with every combat nonseen.

Odds for appearing at the next room, after appearing once: 15%.
Odds for appearing at the 2nd next room, etc: 85/100 * 22/100 = 18,7%.
Odds for appearing at the 3rd next room, etc: 85/100 * 78/100 * 29/100 = 19,2%.
Odds for appearing at the 4th next room, etc: 85/100 * 78/100 * 71/100 * 36/100 = 16,9%.
Odds for appearing at the 5th next room, etc: 85/100 * 78/100 * 71/100 * 64/100 * 43/100 = 12,9%.
Odds for appearing at the 6th next room, etc: 85/100 * 78/100 * 71/100 * 64/100 * 57/100 * 50/100 = 8.5%.
